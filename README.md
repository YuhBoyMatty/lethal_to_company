# lethal_to_company
A wall hack cheat / hack / mod for Lethal Company.
Since this is my first time tackling Unity game, I dont guarantee the quality of code or performance.

Press ESC and open menu once to get GUI rendered because I think is the rendering function kicks in after that.

# Progress
It's currently only ESP for items but i'll implement it for enemy and players too.
